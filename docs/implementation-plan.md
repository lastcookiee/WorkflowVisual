# Implementation Plan

## 1. Core Architecture

- Configure Next.js App Router with shared layout, global styling, and theme provider.
- Establish Tailwind CSS utilities for the monochrome palette and microinteractions.
- Integrate Framer Motion for navigation, hero, builder animations, and traversal preview.

## 2. Workflow Builder Experience

- Create store (`use-workflow-store`) backed by Zustand for nodes, edges, traversal state, and draft persistence.
- Build canvas components: background grid, node cards with drag-and-drop, edge renderer, controller toolbar, and settings panel.
- Implement BFS/DFS traversal via a reusable graph utility (`lib/graph.ts`) with animation-friendly output.

## 3. Persistence & Sync

- Set up Prisma schema for PostgreSQL (`users`, `workflows`, `nodes`, `edges`).
- Implement server actions/API routes for CRUD: list workflows, save draft, load workflow, delete.
- Add localStorage synchronization utilities for offline drafts and cookie-based session caching.

## 4. UI Surface Areas

- Navigation bar with animated hover, sticky blur on scroll, and theme toggle.
- Dashboard hero with CTA, feature highlights, and motion states.
- Builder page featuring canvas, inspector, preview mode, and traversal animation timeline.
- Docs/placeholder pages outlining API usage and quickstart.

## 5. Tooling & Quality

- Configure ESLint, TypeScript paths, and Tailwind.
- Add reusable motion variants and design tokens.
- Provide comprehensive README with setup, workflow, and scripts.
- Prepare Prisma migration script and `.env.example` for database configuration.

## 6. Testing & Launch

- Add minimal unit tests for graph traversal logic.
- Ensure `npm run build` succeeds after dependency installation.
- Document launch and debug instructions.
